                    <p style="font-size: 17px;">
                        The Game is based on a slightly serious theme, Climate Change. Climate Change is a natural
                        phenomenon which can also be controlled by human activities to some extent. Sometimes human
                         beings benefit from this phenomenon, but they also suffer from that. So I start to think that 
                         there should be the play-control character who can change the climate as he wish but sometimes
                         die from that.

                        To be honest, I do add some of my interest in the story of the game.

                        Platformer should be the best type of game to symbolize the period of overcoming a problem, and that's why
                        I choose to design a platformer game. Then, naturally, the ability of the character becomes changing the climate
                        in order to change the scene.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, how to make the game worth playing? Upon me, a platformer that worth playing has following two characters: 
                        a comfortable controller and subtle level design. For part of controller, I assign this to "Techinque" part and you can click
                        this hyperlink (<a href="#two">Technique</a>) to get to that part.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first thing I start to consider is why I feel excited when playing platformers. In <i>HollowKnight</i>, long-time stay in air forces player to 
                        calculate when to use the only jump chance and when to use the dash chance. This kind of design can be seen especially in Path of Pain, 
                        the most difficult part of platformer in <i>HollowKnight</i>. In this level, players are also required to use their attack on gears to reload their chance of dashing and jumping
                        In <i>Celestial</i>, player are also required to calculate their strategy of jumping, but not so strict like HollowKnight. On the other hand, players have to
                        calculate the left energy of the character which is shown by the emotion of the character.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like HollowKnight and Celestial, I prepare dash, jump and climb ability for players. To make the change of scene catch up with the fast pace of platformer game,
                         I design levels that players have to change the climate/scene when they are in air. The thing that different from <i>HollowKnight</i> and <i>Celestial</i> is player's 
                         ability may have side effects on player. Meaning to make the game system not so sophisticated, I provide 3 climate/scene that players can convert to whenever they want. 
                         In <b>Tropical Climate</b>, there are more plants that the character can climb on but also more poisonous plants that will hurt the character. In <b>Desert Climate</b>, there 
                         are down-up wind that can help the character get to some places that that cannot be reached in other climate, but there are fewer walls that the character can climb on. In <b>Pole Climate</b>,
                          the heavy wind will blow the chracter away in one direction and interfere the character's walking pace, but it can also make the character jump farther if being well controlled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then it comes to the question that how to combine the change of the climate with the pace of platformers. Unlike puzzle games, players should be forced use their ability more frequently in a platformer rather
                        choose one climate and just jump. My solution is to force the players to use their abilities when they are in the air.
                        For example, in this level, players have to jump to a platform on which deadly plants are growing. Then naturally they switch to tropical climate to avoid the plants.
                        However, the platforme they stand on is no longer safe in tropical climate. That means they have to jump towards the unsafe platform, during which they switch the climate.
                        Moreover, players will understand the game pace through this way.

                <p>Lilith, the devil who brought magic to human beings, allowed her to find her memories in Lilith's

                    When Arrow is pressed, the charater would not reach its max speed immediately. Instead, it will
                    smoomthly increase its velocity until reach the max speed.
                    When you are using Joy stick, actually you obey the same operating pattern since you can not input
                    0/1 directly through the gamepad
