                <h2>Techniques</h2>
                <h3>Player Controller</h3>
                <p>
                    The player controller of the game can be divided into two parts: the train engine and the carriage.
                </p>
                <h3>train engine</h3>
                <p>
                    The train engine is typically a game object providing the force to make the whole train move. I
                    choose to use the classic type of controlling - throttle and steering wheel. I uses a Math function
                    to make
                    the acceleration of the train linear. The train reaches its top speed after a little period of
                    acceleration and
                    also needs a period of time to stop itself after players stop holding the throttle button.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code data-ln-single-line="true" class="c#">float cos = Mathf.Cos(transform.eulerAngles.z * Mathf.Deg2Rad);
float sin = Mathf.Sin(transform.eulerAngles.z * Mathf.Deg2Rad);
rb.velocity = new Vector2(Mathf.SmoothDamp(rb.velocity.x, 
                                           runSpeed * Time.fixedDeltaTime * 60 * cos, 
                                           ref velocityX, 
                                           AccelerateTime),
                          Mathf.SmoothDamp(rb.velocity.y, 
                                           runSpeed * 60 *  Time.fixedDeltaTime * sin, 
                                           ref velocityY, 
                                           AccelerateTime));
                </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    To simulate the progress of using a steering wheel to change the direction, when players press the
                    left & right button, the rotation of the transform will be changed gradually by a certain speed.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code data-ln-single-line="true" class="c#">if (horizontalmove != 0)
{
    float toAngle = transform.eulerAngles.z - horizontalmove * rotationSpeed * Time.fixedDeltaTime * 60 % 360;
    if (toAngle < 0) {
        toAngle += 360;
    }
    transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(0,0,toAngle) ;
}
                    </code>

                        href="../assets/TrainEngineController.cs">HERE</a></p>
                <h3>Carriage</h3>
                <p>
                    To realize the function that after an attack the carriage fall off from the train engine and being
                    recollected by the train engine, a data structure similar to linked list is applied.
                    Furthermore, since the carriage has two state - being connected to the train engine/the former
                    carriage and falling off from the train engine, a finite state machine is designed to manage
                    the state of the carriage. The state machine keeps the number of the carriage and other components
                    of the carriage.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code data-ln-single-line="true" class="c#">states.Add("Running", new RunningState(this));
states.Add("Stopping", new StoppingState(this));
TransitionState("Stopping");
currentState = states["Stopping"];
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>In stopping state, the carriage is no longer a collider but a trigger. The Joint using to connect
                    itself
                    with the former carriage is disabled so as to fall from that carriage.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code data-ln-single-line="true" class="c#">public void onUpdate()
{
    tm.rb.velocity = (tm.player.transform.position - tm.transform.position).normalized * 9;
}

public void onEnter()
{
    //disable the distance joint
    tm.dj.enabled = false;
    tm.rb.velocity = new Vector2(0, 0);
    //alter the collider to the trigger
    tm.gameObject.GetComponent<BoxCollider2D>().isTrigger = true;
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>On the other hand, in running state, the carriage becomes a collider so that it will hit the other
                    objects in the scene and can interact with the train engine.
                    The joint is enabled and a variable is created to save the former carriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When hitting the Boss, the train engine will disable the carriage and turn it into stop state. Since
                    it is not a trigger in running state, when in stopping state,
                    we can also use this function to deal with the collection of the carriage.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>public void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
{
    if (collision.gameObject.tag == "Player") {
        collision.gameObject.GetComponent<TrainEngineController>().addTrunk(gameObject);
    }
    if (collision.gameObject.tag == "Boss" && state == "Running")
    {
        //do damage to the Boss
        collision.gameObject.GetComponent<FSM>().getHurt();
        player.GetComponent<TrainEngineController>().disableTrunk(num);
    }
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    The train engine is also responsible for the connection and disablility of the carriage.
                    When the carriage is recollected, itself is sent to the train engine. After checking its position
                    the the list of carriages,
                    the joint is set to connect the carriage and the last carriage of the carriage list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the trunk falls from the train, since both itself and the carriage connected to it will fall
                    from the former carriage,
                    a loop is set to disconnect all the carriages from the last to the current one.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>public void addTrunk(GameObject gb)
{
    if (trunks.Count >= 1)
    {
        gb.GetComponent<TrunkStateMachine>().getIn(trunks[trunks.Count - 1], trunks.Count);

                <h2>Game Design</h2>
                <h3>Idea burst</h3>
                <div>
                    <p style="font-size: 17px;">
                        The Thomas comes from the topic of one game jam, which is a picture depicting a
                        man dragging a train with a rope. It's common to think about a combat between human beings and
                        train.
                        Then it comes to a question: How the train fight. A strange but exciting idea suddenly bursted
                        in my brain.
                        It can fight like a whip, using its carriages to hurt enemies. It would be very satisfying if
                        the train draws a
                        big circle in the scene.
                        <br>
                        Then it comes to the idea that the train engine should be the weak point of the train. If the
                        train engine get damaged, the train will die immediately.
                        That means the train should make a sudden turn in order to avoid the train engine being damaged,
                        as well as hit the enemies with its carriages, which makes me think about the bullfight. The
                        train is just like the bullfighter, escaping the attack but also getting closer to the danger.
                        And this determined how we made this game - the Thomas.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>Story</h3>
                <div style="font-size: 17px;">
                    <p>
                        With the King of the Train Kingdom surrendering to human beings, the train are reduced to slaves
                        of human beings. They are forced to convey resources and please human beings.
                        Some trains want to rebel against the brutality of human beings and among them is the main
                        charater - the Thomas.
                        <br>
                        The Thomas used to be a mercenary before the fall of the Train Kingdom. He managed to escape
                        from the human-controlled territory. However, on his last step towards liberty, he ran into a
                        tough enemy - a human bounty hunter. The combat started immediately.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>GamePlay</h3>
                <div style="font-size: 17px;">
                    <p>
                        As has mentioned above, I decided to simulate a feeling of bullfight in my game. A great
                        character of bullfight is the very little distance between dead and alive. When I am designing
                        the train controller and the Boss AI, I purposedly making players cannot hit the Boss easily by
                        just making sudden turns continuously. The smallest arc the train can make is restricted to half
                        size of the scene
                        and since the boss is constantly moving towards the player, if the player keeps holding one
                        direction button and the acceleration button, he can hardly hit the boss twice. This kind of
                        design makes the player have to focus on his position after making an attack, which as a result
                        makes the pace of the game more fast and more intensely.
                    </p>
                    <div style="width: 100%; text-align:center">
                        <img src="/images/g1.png" style="width:50%">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the carriages of the train would fall from the train engine after an attack. How to
                        collect
                        the fallen carriages as well as escape the attacks from the Boss. The fallen carriages will move
                        towards the player with a rather small speed. This helps avoid the carriages get stuck in
                        certain
                        areas and reduces the difficulty of the game.
