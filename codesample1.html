                        The game is based on a slightly serious theme, Climate Change. Climate Change is a natural
                        phenomenon which can also be controlled by human activities to some extent. Sometimes human
                        beings benefit from this phenomenon, but they also suffer from that. So I start to think that
                        the play-control character should change the climate as he wishes but sometimes dies from that.
                        And then comes the Climate Magi, a magi with the ability to change the climate. Sometimes he
                        benefits from the lush vines of Tropical Climate, by which he can get to a higher platform or
                        overcome some trouble. Sometimes he gets hurt due to the overwhelmingly grown poison vines in
                        his way.

                    <p>
                        Platformer should be the best type of game to symbolize the period of overcoming a problem, and
                        that's why
                        I choose to design a platformer game. Then, naturally, the ability of the character becomes
                        changing the climate
                        in order to change the scene.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, how to make the game worth playing? Upon me, a platformer that worth playing has following
                        two characters:
                        a comfortable controller and exciting level design. For part of controller, I assign this to
                        "Techinque" part and you can click
                        this hyperlink (<a href="#two">Technique</a>) to get to that part.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first thing I start to consider is why I feel excited when playing platformers. In
                        <i>HollowKnight</i>, long-time stay in air forces player to
                        calculate when to use the only jump chance and when to use the dash chance. This kind of design
                        can be seen especially in Path of Pain,
                        the most difficult part of platformer in <i>HollowKnight</i>. In this level, players are also
                        required to use their attack on gears to reload their chance of dashing and jumping
                        In <i>Celestial</i>, player are also required to calculate their strategy of jumping, but not so
                        strict like HollowKnight. On the other hand, players have to
                        calculate the left energy of the character which is shown by the emotion of the character.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like HollowKnight and Celestial, I prepare dash, jump and climb ability for players. To make the
                        change of scene catch up with the fast pace of platformer game,
                        I design levels that players have to change the climate/scene when they are in air. The thing
                        that different from <i>HollowKnight</i> and <i>Celestial</i> is player's
                        ability may have side effects on player. Meaning to make the game system not so sophisticated, I
                        provide 3 climate/scene that players can convert to whenever they want.
                        In <b>Tropical Climate</b>, there are more plants that the character can climb on but also more
                        poisonous plants that will hurt the character. In <b>Desert Climate</b>, there
                        are down-up wind that can help the character get to some places that that cannot be reached in
                        other climate, but there are fewer walls that the character can climb on. In <b>Pole
                            Climate</b>,
                        the heavy wind will blow the chracter away in one direction and interfere the character's
                        walking pace, but it can also make the character jump farther if being well controlled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then it comes to the question that how to combine the change of the climate with the pace of
                        platformers. Unlike puzzle games, players should be forced use their ability more frequently in
                        a platformer rather than
                        choose one climate and just jump. My solution is to force the players to use their abilities
                        when they are in the air.
                    </p>
                    <div style="display:table-cell; text-align:center">
                        <div style="display: flex;">
                            <img src="/images/g1pp1.png" style="width: 50%;">
                            <img src="/images/g1pp2.png" style="width: 50%;">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        For example, in this level, players have to jump to a platform on which deadly plants are
                        growing. Then naturally they switch to tropical climate to avoid the plants.
                        However, the platforme they stand on is no longer safe in tropical climate. That means they have
                        to jump towards the unsafe platform, during which they switch the climate.
                        Moreover, players will understand the game pace through this way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is also possible to design some interesting mechanisms. For example, at the end of the game, there is
                        a continuous up-moving
                        elevator made by the up air stream in Desert Climate. These mechanisms promise huge space on
                        further level design.
                    </p>
